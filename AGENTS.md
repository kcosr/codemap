# Agent Onboarding (Codemap)

This file is a lightweight, internal onboarding note for agents working in this repo. It is not part of the product output.

## Start Here

- Read `README.md` for the project goal, CLI usage, and API basics.
- Core code lives in `src/`, tests in `tests/`.

## Conventions

- TypeScript, ESM modules, NodeNext resolution (see `tsconfig.json`).
- Keep edits ASCII-only unless a file already uses Unicode.
- Prefer small, focused changes; match existing file layout and naming.

## Testing Requirements

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `npm test` for all functional changes.
- Run `npm run build` if you touch the CLI, exports, or public API signatures.
- `npm run build:bun` is optional for local-only binary testing.
- If you cannot run tests, call it out explicitly in your response.

## Changelog

Location: `CHANGELOG.md` (root)

### Format

Use these sections under `## [Unreleased]`:
- `### Breaking Changes` - API changes requiring migration
- `### Added` - New features
- `### Changed` - Changes to existing functionality
- `### Fixed` - Bug fixes
- `### Removed` - Removed features

### Rules

- New entries ALWAYS go under `## [Unreleased]`
- Append to existing subsections (e.g., `### Fixed`), do not create duplicates
- NEVER modify already-released version sections (e.g., `## [0.0.1]`)
- Use inline PR links: `([#123](<pr-url>))`

### Attribution

- Internal changes: `Fixed foo bar ([#123](<pr-url>))`
- External contributions: `Added feature X ([#456](<pr-url>) by [@user](https://github.com/user))`

## Releasing

### During Development

When preparing PRs for main, open the PR first to get the PR number, then update `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]` with that PR number and push a follow-up commit.

### When Ready to Release

1. Checkout and update main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   ```
2. Verify `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` includes all changes.
3. Run the release script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/release.mjs patch   # 0.0.0 -> 0.0.1
   node scripts/release.mjs minor   # 0.0.1 -> 0.1.0
   node scripts/release.mjs major   # 0.1.0 -> 1.0.0
   ```

Notes:
- Requires the `gh` CLI and an authenticated GitHub session.
- Script expects a clean working tree, bumps `package.json` version, updates `CHANGELOG.md`, tags `vX.Y.Z`, pushes, and creates a prerelease.
- `scripts/bump-version.mjs` keeps `package.json` and `package-lock.json` in sync.
